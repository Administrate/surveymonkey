# Contributing to surveymonkey

:+1::tada: Hello fellow Administrator! Firstly thank you for making our
product better and taking the time to read our guidelines. You rock :metal:

The following are a few guidelines for contributing to Neoteric. But they
are just *guidelines*, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Before going any further please read our [Code Review Guidelines]. They will give
you a good understanding of what is required in order to get your code into production.

We want your contributions to be **exceptional** but not surprising. Open
your pull request early! Don't wait until you think you're code complete.
Remember early feedback on implementation and design strategy can be useful to
ensure that the work is progressing in a way that matches the overall vision
for the project and the code.

## The Pull Request template

When you open a new Pull Request the comment area will be pre-filled with our
PR template. Unfortunately Github does not support variable substitution so
you're going to have to manually update this template yourself.

For the *title* and *short description* simply delete the placeholder text
and add your own values. Please do not edit/delete the *checklist* items.
You can check them off by clicking on the checkboxes once you have saved the
comment or by placing an `x` between the brackets like `[x]`.

Please delete the instructions from the bottom of the PR template once you have read them.
